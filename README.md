# SQL_Challenge
Module 9

File with starter code added, this includes the 6 csv files

Folder created for workings 'EmployeeSQL'
contents:
     - PNG from QuickDBD 'Employees ERD Image File'
     - Screenshot from QuickDBD to include the workings 'Employees ERD Full Screen'
     - SQL file for table creation 'employees_table_schemata'
     - SQL file for queries on the employees data

NOTE for queries:
    Inner joins were used for linking tables to query only on items that met all criteria.

    Although the dataset was full, eg every employee was included on the salaries table, and every department had a manager,
    I would consult with my team at Pewlett Hackard to consider if these queries should include only all connected data or if it should also highlight
    where/if there were gaps. Considering the age (and probable non-maintenence) of the dataset it could be possible to have missing pieces.

    As comments in my queries I have noted where I would change my joins to query even if some data is missing, eg an employee on the list, but with no listing on the salaries table
